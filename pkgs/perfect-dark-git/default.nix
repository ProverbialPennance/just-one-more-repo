          This is a port of Ryan Dywer's decompilation of classic N64 shooter Perfect Dark to modern systems.

          You'll need to provide a copy of the ROM at $HOME/.local/share/perfectdark/data/pd.${romID}.z64 to launch to game.

          You can also change the ROM variant of this game with an expression like this:

          `pd.override { romID = "jpn-final" }`

          Supported romIDs are `${lib.generators.toPretty {} roms}`.

          `ntsc-final` the default as it is the only recommended one by upstream.
