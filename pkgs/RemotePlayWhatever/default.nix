        Tiny application that lets you force remote play together any game you have in your steam library including non-steam ones.

        RemotePlayWhatever communicates with your running Steam client and instructs it to initiate a Remote Play Together session for the currently running game launched through Steam.
        It does this by using undocumented and potentially unstable internal Steam client APIs.
